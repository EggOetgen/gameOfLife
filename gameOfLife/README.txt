My Project is an implementation of Game of Life, which i have altered. I have implemented to new ‘creatures’, one red squiggly and a green mould like thing. The program can be rest using the space bar, the mouseX position will control the growth rate of the green cells, while mouseY the the red when the project is reset. By pressing ‘1’ you can toggle on or off the normal game of life cells.
